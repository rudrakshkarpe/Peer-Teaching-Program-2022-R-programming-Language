### Types of Variables in R programming Langauge
```{r}
# interger

x <- 2 

# to make it interger keep it like 2L

typeof(x)

# double

y <- 2.5  # decimal point 
typeof(y)


# double mode is default mode in
# R programming langauge

# complex

z <- 3 +2i
  
typeof(z)

# character

a <- "Rudraksh"

typeof(a)

# logical 

q1 <- T

typeof(q1)
```


```{r}
A <- 10
B <- 5

c <- A+B

# printing out the variable

c

variable1 <- 2.5
variable2 <- 4

sum <- variable1 / variable2
sum

# That is how you implement the code using the new programs

answer <- sqrt(variable2)
answer
```


### operations on the character operator 

```{r}
greetings <- "Hello"

name <- "Rudraksh"

Message <- paste(greetings, name)
Message
```

### Logical Variables and operators

```{r}
# TRUE  or T

# FALSE or F


4 < 5
7 == 7
7 != 0
7 <= 0
8 >= 9

# &
# isTRUE(x)

result <- 4<5
result
