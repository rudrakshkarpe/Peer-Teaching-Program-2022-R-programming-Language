## WHat is a vector in R programming?

- Sequence of data element with the same basic type

- it's basically like an array in C++ programming language

- The name comes from the linear algebra as it's a statistical language comes from the mathematics background

- we can even have some character vector the only condition would be to keep the data members of the same type.

### secret of R programming language?

- even a single no. is stored as a vector in R programming language

- it's stored as vector of length one.

```{r}


MyFirstVector <- c(63, 13, 262, 16, 26, 14, 12)
MyFirstVector
is.numeric(MyFirstVector)
is.integer(MyFirstVector) # turns about to be false as double is the default mode in the R programming language.
is.double((MyFirstVector))


Test <- c(44L,77L, 442L)
Test

is.integer(Test)

# let's make a character vector

Test2 <- c('Rudraksh', 'programmer', 'Developer', 'Machine Learning')
Test2

is.character(Test2)

seq() ## sequence --> very similar to the operator like ':'

rep() # replicate function

seq(1, 15)
1:15

z <- seq(1,15,4)
z


## last way of creating vector i.e. replicate

rep(3,50)

d <- rep(3,50)
d

e <-rep("Rudra", 10)

j <- rep(d,10) # replicatign vector itself
j
```












## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
